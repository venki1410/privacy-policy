  <h1>TVK SPS – Safety Standards Against CSAE</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Zero Tolerance Policy</h2>
    <p>
      TVK SPS maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). 
      We are committed to ensuring our platform is safe for all users and does not host, promote, or distribute 
      any harmful content related to CSAE.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Content Monitoring & Moderation</h2>
    <p>
      We regularly monitor user-submitted content using automated tools and manual reviews to detect and remove 
      any content that violates our safety policies. Any detected CSAE content is immediately removed and 
      reported to relevant authorities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      Users are encouraged to report any suspicious or abusive content through the in-app reporting feature 
      or by contacting our support team. All reports are treated with high priority and confidentiality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Collaboration with Authorities</h2>
    <p>
      We cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies and child protection organizations to report and 
      act on any CSAE-related activity detected through our platform.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Safety by Design</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is built with safety in mind. We limit user interactions, apply strict content rules, and use 
      secure backend systems to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of the platform.
    </p>
